                                <p class="content">The product I am reviewing is the mobile version of Spotify. Spotify is a music streaming service that allows individuals to pay for subscriptions to access a large pool of music. I use Spotify daily to listen to music, discover new artists, and make playlists where I separate the music into different moods or genres. A major design flaw on the mobile app is the song deletion process. Let’s say you come across a song that you no longer like, and you want to remove it from your playlist. You click on the song settings which is the three-dotted tab in the top right corner. Upon opening the settings there is no option to remove the song that is playing from the current playlist. 
                                </p>
                                    <!-- <p class='content'>To remove a specific song from the playlist, the user must 
                                        exit the song page to the playlist page, navigate the playlist by clicking 
                                        on the playlist settings, search for the song, press the three dotted tab 
                                        for the song settings and then remove the song.
                                    This is a design flaw because it does not follow the following usability 
                                    principles. This design flaw is not consistent with good natural mapping. 
                                    Natural mapping is the understanding between the controls and the expected 
                                    outcomes on the technology. The mobile app reflects poor mapping because the 
                                    three dotted tab is counterintuitive for the user. Simply put, the three dots 
                                    in the top right corner implies that those are all the controls related to the 
                                    song. They are, however only for all actions EXCEPT for removing a song which 
                                    causes confusion. Furthermore, there is no indication as how someone can 
                                    successfully remove a song from a playlist. Secondly, this design element 
                                    violates heuristic rule #7, flexibility and efficiency of use. Flexibility 
                                    and efficiency of use relates to the capability of design elements to 
                                    accelerate the process of doing a routine task. Imagine you want to go 
                                    through a playlist of 200 and remove 20 songs you no longer like. The 
                                    current system for song deletion will take a long time. Moreover, the current 
                                    process for song deletion implies that a user will remember the name of the 
                                    song, which is not always the case if they have many songs in a playlist.
                                        To fix this design error, a red trash bin button should be added directly 
                                        under the song page.The trash bin icon makes song removal more intuitive. 
                                        A physical trash bin is for items that we no longer want. This concept is 
                                        what will make the connection between the controls and their actions 
                                        clearer. Lastly, the trash bin icon addresses the issue of heuristic rule 
                                        #7. If an individual was able to remove songs while they are playing via 
                                        the trash bin icon, the process would be accelerated and require less 
                                        steps on the user’s end. The way to evaluate my design revision would 
                                        be to conduct an experiment where two users each would be asked to 
                                        give researchers a list of 90 songs they like and 10 they strongly 
                                        dislike (roughly three minutes each). Researchers would place the 
                                        disliked songs in the 10th position of the playlist (where the 10th, 
                                        20th, 30th songs are the disliked songs in the playlist). The task 
                                        for each user would be to play the playlist in order and remove these
                                         10 songs. One user would use the current Spotify mobile app, and the 
                                         other would use the Spotify that includes my
                                        design recommendation. This experiment will demonstrate which design 
                                        model will allow users to remove songs they do not like, in a faster 
                                        and more efficient manner. </p> -->
